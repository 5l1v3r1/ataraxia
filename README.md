# Welcome to Ataraxia Linux 

## Introduction
Ataraxia Linux is an **independent** multi-platform general purpose operating system, based on [Linux kernel](http://kernel.org/), [musl libc](http://www.musl-libc.org/) and [busybox](https://busybox.net/). Ataraxia Linux is aimed to be simple, compact and safe, because was founded on the KISS and could be used on desktop, servers and embedded devices. Ataraxia Linux is available for x86, ARM, MIPS, Motorola 68000 and RISC-V. It uses it's own package manager called "[ne](https://github.com/ataraxialinux/ne)" which is used to be friendly wrapper for "[dpkg](https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/Dpkg)" and compatible with [CRUX](https://crux.nu/) Pkgfiles. Ataraxia Linux is oriented towards advanced Linux users, who know what they're doing.
